# Neumann-Network
NN: open-source web3 solution everyone benefits

# Outline
mainly constitutes three parallel chains modeling Avalanche Protocol: pay chain(employ Solana L1 and Solflare wallet), network chain(on-chain subgroups subnets like Semaphore Protocol and off-chain privacy nodes like Mina Protocol) and contract chain(employ phala contract and metamask wallet)
employ DB3 as network dapp database and Latitude as servers

# Architecture
(inspried by https://github.com/farm-fe/farm)
the TypeScript side: API call and on-chain structure
the Python side: smart contract operate and off-chain 'if-else'
